# Digit Recognition - Bernoulli Naive Bayes
An implementation of Bernoulli Naive Bayes [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/submit) digit recognizer.

The algorithm used can be found in [nlp.stanford.edu](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/the-bernoulli-model-1.html)

- Input: train.csv and test.csv
- Output: result.csv (that should be submited in kaggle)

with this configuration ( smothing = 0.01 / 0.03 and data binarization > 128 ) I got 83.657%
